            This page is based on the image below, which depicts the music collection of Aajonus Vonderplanitz. I discovered many great songs through it and decided to share it with others. It should be noted that this page does not contain the complete collection, as some tapes are harder to find or I simply don't know which album it is due to the insufficient labeling.
